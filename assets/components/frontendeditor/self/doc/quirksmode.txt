Error loading TinyMCE.

If you encounter a TinyMCE loading error, this is most likely due to the fact that the page is missing
<!DOCTYPE html> tag. Perhaps you intentionally use DOCTYPE to switch your browser to Quirks Mode,
for example such as: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"> If so, then you will not be able to run
editor on pages with this tag.
